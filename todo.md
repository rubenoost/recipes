# UI Improvements

## High Impact
- [x] Placeholder images - Recipe cards without images look empty. Add a default food illustration
- [ ] Ingredient checkboxes - Let users check off ingredients while cooking
- [ ] Sticky ingredients sidebar - Keep ingredients visible while scrolling through instructions
- [x] Active nav state - Highlight current page in navigation

## Nice to Have
- [ ] Recipe card tags - Show 1-2 tags on cards for quick filtering context
- [ ] Print button - Print styles exist, but no visible button to trigger printing
- [ ] Servings adjuster - Scale ingredient amounts dynamically
- [ ] Skip to content link - Accessibility improvement
- [ ] Back to top button - Helpful on longer recipes

## Polish
- [ ] Better focus states - More visible keyboard navigation
- [ ] Breadcrumbs - "Home > Recepten > [Recipe name]"
- [x] Mobile hamburger menu - Nav wrapping on mobile isn't ideal
